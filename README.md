# Responsive Design Issues with Tailwind CSS

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS:  lack of responsiveness on smaller screens. The issue involves text being cut off and elements overlapping, leading to a broken layout.  The solution involves using Tailwind's responsive modifiers to adjust the styling based on screen size.

## Problem

The provided code uses Tailwind classes to style a flexbox container.  However, on smaller screens, the `w-1/2` class occupies too much horizontal space causing the text to overflow and become unreadable. 

## Solution

The solution is to add Tailwind's responsive modifiers, such as `sm:w-full`, to adjust the width of the inner div based on the screen size. This ensures a better user experience on different devices.
